## Project Description
The Smart Rice Cooker is an IoT-based cooking solution designed for convenience, precision, and customization. Integrated with ingredient containers and connected to the Blynk mobile app, it enables users to remotely control and monitor the cooking process with ease.

Users simply input the serving amount and desired serving time into the app. The system automatically calibrates the rice portion, recommends the correct water level based on desired rice type, and activates cooking 20 minutes before the target serving time - with LCD display that shows a real-time cooking countdown and a “finished” message upon completion, in addition to LED signals:

  Red LED – Cooking in progress
  Green LED – Meal ready

Additionally, the Blynk app sends notifications when the rice is finished, ensuring users are always informed.
